`puppet-minecraft` installs and configures your Minecraft or
CraftBukkit server with Puppet!

This fork of `puppet-minecraft` (`nhinds/puppet-minecraft`) brings support for:
* Ubuntu 16.04 with systemd
* managing ops/whitelist/banned IPs/banned players with the updated JSON format
* multiple server instances (thanks to a branch of `joshbeard/puppet-minecraft`)

This module has been tested on Ubuntu Server 16.04 with Puppet 3.8.5.

## Usage

The simplest possible usage is:

```puppet
include minecraft

minecraft::instance { my-instance: }
```

This entire class is parameterized (see the minecraft class for
details), and can be configured through hiera.

Parameters are available which control how the Minecraft installation
behaves:

* `user`: The user account for the Minecraft service
* `group`: The user group for the Minecraft service
* `install_base`: The base directory in which Minecraft instances will be installed under
* `instances`: A hash of instances. Keys are the name of the instance, values are a hash of parameters for `minecraft::instance`
* `instance_defaults`: The default parameters for all instances
* `manage_java`: Manage the JRE package

`minecraft::instance` resources have the following parameters:
* `user`: The user account for the Minecraft service
* `group`: The user group for the Minecraft service
* `install_dir`: The directory in which Minecraft stores its data
* `source`: Minecraft (semvar) or CraftBukkit ('recommended',
  'beta', or 'dev'), or direct source (URL for `wget`)
* `service_ensure`: What state the service should be (e.g. 'running')
* `xmx`: The maximum Java heap size for the Minecraft service
  in megabytes
* `xms`: The initial Java heap size for the Minecraft service
  in megabytes
* `ops`: Players which should be ops
* `banned_players`: Players which should be banned
* `banned_ips`: IPs which should be banned
* `white_list_players`: Players which should be whitelisted. Does nothing unless the `white-list` server property is also set to `true`
* `server_properties`: Hash of properties to set in Minecraft's `server.properties`

### Minecraft Versions / CraftBukkit Builds

A particular version of Minecraft server can be downloaded by
specifying the `source` parameter. This parameter accepts a semantic
version (representing a vanilla Minecraft server), a snapshot version,
or for a [CraftBukkit](http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/)
installation, one of 'recommended', 'beta', or 'dev'. Latest vanilla
version as of this writing is 1.7.5.

Please note that once a JAR file (the server) has been downloaded to
`install_dir`, if you want to switch, you will need to manually remove
it so that the `wget::fetch` resource can update; this is a _good
thing_ as it means the tags (e.g. "recommended") will not auto-update
your server. This is good because you must beware incompatibilities
among Minecraft and CraftBukkit versions with world files, settings,
etc, so backup and test thoroughly before you update. (At least rolling
back to an old version is easy.)

Speaking of old versions, prior to the release of Minecraft 1.6, the
downloads were hosted at a different
[location](http://assets.minecraft.net/), but since these are quite
old, this module does not currently support it. Submit a Pull Request
if you add support, or make an issue if you want me to do so.

### Managing players

This module manages the Minecraft player settings.
To add players to a particular list, declare an array of
them:

```puppet
minecraft::instance { 'my-instance':
  ops                => ['me'],
  banned_players     => [ 'griefer', 'badboy' ],
  banned_ips         => ['127.0.0.1'],         # Don't actually do this
  white_list_players => [ 'my_best_friend' ],
  server_properties  => { 'white-list' => true },
}
```

Note that when any of these parameters is set to undef, Puppet will
not manage the corresponding file, allowing you to manage it via
commands in Minecraft. However, if specified, Puppet will manage the
file, and overwrite any manual changes on the next application of
Puppet.

To enable the whitelist, you must both set `white-list` to `true` in `server_properties`
and add players to the whitelist here, as they affect separate
files. Additionally, blacklists (banned IPs/players) is pointless
if the whitelist is enabled, and is only shown here concurrently for
demonstration purposes.

### Java

If `manage_java` is true, this module will use
[Puppetlabs' Java module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java)
to install the necessary Java Runtime Environment.

### Adding CraftBukkit Plugins

CraftBukkit plugins can be installed by using the defined resource
`minecraft::plugin`. You must specify the plugin name (lacking the
'.jar' file extension) and the complete URL for the download source.

#### Dynmap Example

The
[Dynmap plugin](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1543523-dynmap-dynamic-web-based-maps-for-minecraft/)
can be configured like this:

```puppet
minecraft::plugin { 'dynmap':
  source => 'http://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/757/982/dynmap-1.9.1.jar'
}
```

Or using Hiera like this:

```yaml
minecraft::plugins:
  dynmap:
    source: http://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/757/982/dynmap-1.9.1.jar
```

Once enabled, a web-based map of the server will be available at
[localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123). James Fryman's
[nginx module](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/jfryman/nginx) could then
be used to proxy the server through
[map.domain.tld](http://map.domain.tld) like thus:

```puppet
nginx::resource::vhost { 'map.domain.tld':
  proxy            => 'http://localhost:8123',
  proxy_set_header => [ 'Host $host' ],
}
```

Or again in Hiera,

```yaml
nginx::nginx_vhosts:
  map.domain.tld:
    proxy: http://localhost:8123
    proxy_set_header:
      - Host $host
```

Note that Nginx setup is not within the scope of this module, and is
simply provided as a tip.

## Caveats

This package uses
[Puppetlabs' stdlib module](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib)
for the `ensure_resource` function, which it uses on the `screen`
package (utilized for running the Minecraft server as a background
service). This is currently the safest way to declare a
possibly-conflicting dependency.

## Testing

Testing of this package occurs on an Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS machine, using
Puppet 3.4.3. This is made easy using
[vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), and my own
[box](https://vagrantcloud.com/andschwa/ubuntu-precise-latest-puppet).
